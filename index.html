                <p><strong>T</strong>he story begins with Dashratha and his 3 wives ruling the kingdom Kosala, with the capital Ayodhya. The king and queens perform a special ritual to pray for children. Soon, Dasratha has 4 sons: Rama from Kaushalya, Bharata from Kaikeyi, and Lakshman and Shatrugna from Sumitra.</p>
                <p>Rama becomes known as a virtuous warrior and Vishamitra asks Dashratha to send Rama to help him defeat the demoness Tadka. After this incident, Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to King Janak's swayamvara for his daughter Sita. Rama wins the contest by lifting and breaking Shiva's bow, and he and Sita get married. The 3 brothers also get married to Sita's other sister.</p>
                <p>Dashratha decides it is time to make Rama his successor. Kaikeyi agrees that as the eldest son, Rama deserves the throne. Manthara tells Kaikeyi that if Rama is crowned king, the other queens will become more powerful and that they will harass Kaikeyi and Bharat. Manthara reminds Kaikeyi that she has two boons to ask of Dashratha. She asks Dashratha to crown Bharata as king and send Ram into exile for 14 years. Dashratha is pained to see him go, but Rama is determined not to disobey his father's orders. Lakshmana and Sita decide to join Rama in exile.</p>
                <p>Dashratha dies longing for Rama and Bharata refuses to be a part of his mother's conspiracy. Bharata follows Rama and asks him to come back, but Rama refuses, so Bharata takes his sandals back as a symbol of Rama's rule over Ayodhya.</p>
