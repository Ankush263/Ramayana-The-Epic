                <p>In exile, Agastya gifts the brothers divine weapons that make them invincible. In the thirteenth year of exile, Ravana's sister Surpankha meets Rama in the forest and is attracted to him. When he politely declines her offer to come with her, she threatens to kill Sita. To protect them, Lakshman cuts off her nose. When Ravana hears of his sister's humiliation, he plans revenge by harming Sita.</p>
                <p>In the forest, Sita sees a beautiful deer and asks Rama to capture it for her. Rama goes to find the deer and instructs Lakshman to protect Sita while he's gone. When Rama strikes the deer, it is actually Marich in disguise, and he calls out for Sita and Lakshman in Rama's voice. Sita urges Lakshmana to go make sure Rama is okay, and he draws a divine line of security around her to protect her while she is alone, telling her that she should not cross the line under any circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>Ravana approaches Sita in disguise as an old sage seeking alms. He tricks her into exiting Lakshmana's circle of protection. Once she steps outside the boundary, he kidnaps her and takes her into the sky to Lanka. Jatayu tries to save Sita but Ravana nearly kills him. To leave a trace of her path, Sita drops her jewelry from the sky, hoping someone will find it and trace their way back to her.
