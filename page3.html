                <p>Rama and Lakshmana come back to the hermitage and grieve over the missing Sita. Looking for her in the forest, the encounter the nearly dead Jatayu, who tells them she has been abducted. In their quest to find Sita, the brothers meet Shabri, who serves them devotedly.</p>
                <p>Ram and Lakshman reach Kishkindha, the kingdom of monkeys, where they meet Hanuman. Hanuman tells them that King Sugreev can help them if they help him win over his evil brother, Bali. Rama helps King Sugreeva win his kingdom back and he enlists his entire monkey army to help find Sita. Rama gives Hanuman his ring to show to Sita if he finds her, so she can trust him. He tells Hanuman and Angada's team to look for her in the southern part of India.</p>
                <p>Hanuman meets Jatayu's younger brother, who describes that he saw Ravana abducting a young woman and heading towards the island of Lanka. The monkeys are unsure how to cross the ocean, and Hanuman uses his powers to become extremely large and cross the ocean despite encountering obstacles along the way. When he arrives at Lanka, he makes himself tiny so he can sneak in. Once he finds the palace, Hanuman enters the garden and sees Sita from atop a tree. He overhears Ravana threatening Sita that she must accept him in two months.</p>
