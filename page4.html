                <p>Hanuman shows Sita Ram's ring and asks her to come back with him. Sita refuses and says that to protect her honor, Rama must come save her and defeat Ravana himself. Hanuman wreaks havoc in Lanka. Ravana captures him and Hanuman warns him of war if he does not release Sita. To punish him, Ravana orders that Hanuman's tail be lit on fire. With the fire on his tail, Hanuman burns down the city. Ravana's brother Vibhishan tries to reason with him, so Ravana kicks him out of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The war begins and the monkey army destroys much of Ravana's army. Ravana's wife asks him to reconsider and let Sita go, but he is further determined to win this war. Ravana sends his giant brother Kumbhakaran to the battlefield. Lakshmana is badly wounded and Hanuman brings the entire mountain that contains the divine herb Sanjeevani to revive him. Ravana sends his son who uses illusory powers to show Rama Sita's severed head. Ravana also shows Sita an illusion of Rama's severed head. The monkey army interrupts Meghnad's ritual before he is granted invincibility. Finally, Ravana himself enters the battlefield. After a battle, Rama kills Ravana by shooting an arrow into his navel, his weak spot.</p>
                <p>Ram and Sita are united and the trio return to Ayodhya after fourteen years. They are welcomed by all of the mothers and Rama is throned the king.</p>
